The layout for most of the site's pages are highly stylized and very readable. Everything is in large font with colorful and attractive graphics sprinkled over the length of the content. The graphics change as time passes for one and the user scrolls for the other. It displays a good amount of information about the product although it does so in one large page rather than having it broken up. This is something of an ambiguous design decision in my eyes, as a lot of useful content is aggregated together but the large amount of scrolling to read it all is slightly annoying.

The navigation seems a bit lacking. Links to navigate to the rest of the site from the front page only appear at the bottom of the page, which is a bit annoying. In addition, there is a persistent bar on the front page that appears at the top of the screen advertising a free trial of the software which cannot be closed. This is somewhat problematic as it takes up a decent chunk of screen real estate while only providing a single meaningful link. On the whole, the site has excellent styling and good placement of meaningful content but poor navigation placement.
