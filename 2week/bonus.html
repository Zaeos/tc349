<p><h3>Personal Bio</h3></p>

<p><h3>Panic.com</h3></p>
<p>The first page has some really smooth mouseover animations on their images and their banner is friendly and inviting.
The layout of the page is absurdly oversized though, everything on the opening page could easily be shown without needing a scrollbar.
In addition there is a huge amount of whitespace which could be restructured to look better and include more content.
In particular, I think a consistent navigation bar right at the top of each page would be very helpful so you could move through the site more quickly without having to click through several links.

<p>
The blog page is is tremendously large and in desperate need of pagination. No one needs to see an ENTIRE BLOG on one page.
Other than that it seems like most of the site is fairly well strucstured, with links at the top of each page relative to the current content, attractive and consistent styling and a wealth of relevant information.
The lack of consistent navigation, content sizing, and dead space are the most outstandingly in-need-of-fixing aspects of the site.
