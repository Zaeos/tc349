Happycog has a lovely site layout. The banner at the top is eye-catching and welcoming, but what I really like about it is the navbar at its bottom that sticks to the top of the page when you scroll down. This leaves a persistent navigation bar across the entire page so that other parts of the site can be easily accessed at all times. The number of columns in the main block of content changes depending on the content in that area of the page which makes the layout more dynamic and interesting.

The content of the pages is heavily stylized and very readable. The different sections are clearly labeled and long enough to provide a good wealth of relevant content and links without becoming tedious. The content is broken up such that each main content block takes up one full screen which adds an extra touch of attractiveness to it. Overall, the site has excellent layout, content, and navigation.
