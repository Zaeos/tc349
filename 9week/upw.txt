United Pixel Workers has a decent setup. The navigation bar at the top provides useful links around the site but does not make as good of use of the space it has available as it possibly could. There are large spaces in the nav bar that are unfilled even while the existing links are relatively small and could easily be resized to be more consistent and easier to read. The links are fairly comprehensive and lead to lots of good content, they just could be sized better.

The bulk of the screen's content is too cluttered for my taste. There seems to be a large grid to contain all of the different content but it is spread around rather haphazardly. There are descriptions of products on the grid next to the product they are describing, but some descriptions are below, some are to the side, and some products have no descriptions. In addition, the grid is quite large and takes up the entire screen in parts. There's nothing to clearly draw your eye too and it is not very aesthetically appealing. There is also a "sign up for our newsletter" box that exists both at the bottom bar and arbitrarily placed in the middle of the field of content boxes. Overall the site's design has potential but needs some cleaning up.
