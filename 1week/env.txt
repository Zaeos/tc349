For my development environment, I am using Notepad++, Git BASH, and Google Chrome
I like Git BASH because its commands are Linux-y but functions very nicely in a Windows environment
I like Chrome because it is fast (unlike IE) and not bloated (like Firefox)
I like Notepad++ because it supports lots of languages and has nice indenting and styling and is very intuitive to use (unlike Vi)
