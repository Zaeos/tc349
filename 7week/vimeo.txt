Vimeo has an attractive and intuitive site layout. The splash image at the top provides an attractive entrance to the site. Following this,
the different content sections as you scroll down have different background colors to separate the blocks of content. This makes it very
easy to take in at a glance the different major sections of content on the first page. All of the content on the page gives enough information
and links to be informative without being large enough to make the page tediously long.

The bar on the top is fairly mimimal but still provides quick links to what will be the most typically visited portions of the site. The 
bar on the bottom has a few more links that are more specific and well-placed in that they are easy to find for those looking but not
taking up too much prime screen real estate for those who are not. In addition, the javascript elements on the page are fluid and attractive
and the handful of minimalistic decorations around the different content areas makes the site much less boring to look at than it would be
otherwise. Overall, I would say this site demonstrates some fairly excellent design practices.
