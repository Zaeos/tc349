The design for etsy is mostly done in light colors like white, grey, and light blue. This makes the style very consistent, if perhaps a little bright to look at. The bulk of the main page's content is divided into different clearly-labeled sections which have links to relevant content in each. Each section has several links to pages relevant to the section title and a brief description. Overall, this it has an excellent amount of relevant material with just enough description to give an idea of what each page is about.

The navigation top and sidebar are well-structured as well. The top has just several major links like "log in" and a search bar. The sidebar lists all of the major categories of products sold on the site as well as links to some more general sections which can be used to link to more general product categories. All in all, this site has been structured to offer quick access to many different parts of the site and provide a wealth of relevant content to the user without cluttering up the screen.
