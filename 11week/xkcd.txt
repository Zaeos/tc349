The site is extremely minimal, displaying only a comic and a navigation bar. In addition there are three links to different parts of the website, including one link to the (also) mobile version of the archive.

Considering the nature of the content of the site (comics) I think this layout, while very simplistic, is also very effective. Any more additional content would be reltively useless and more likely than not just clutter up the screen.
