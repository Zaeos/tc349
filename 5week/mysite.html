	<h1>My Aim and the Interpretation By Associated Parties</h2>
	<p>I designed this more or less in a blog format, entries separated by singly-linked pages of moderate size. Each page
			would have access to more general information of the site, intended to be clearly separate from the more 
			stylized bulk of the site. Each page ought to have styling suited to the manner of the content.
	</p>
	<p>Derrick stuck with a blog-style format but also added an additional category of "Related Sites"
	</p>
	<p>Jim broke the style into more specific categories, taking more specific branches of the site to aggregate content easier.
			I find it curious that he did not place the card "Kinds of Pie I like" with "Information About the Webmaster".
	</p>
	<p>I'm not entirely sure how seriously Karl was taking this as his reasoning for his grouping were very general but also,
			curiously, a perfect mirror of my own. I take this as an encouraging sign.
