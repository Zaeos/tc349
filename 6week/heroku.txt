Heroku.com has excellent design. The color scheme is cool and dark but always very legible. The top bar has the company logo and links to
some of the more major portions of the site, inlcuding a login screen. The bottom bar isn't initially seen but, once scrolled down to,
has many more detailed links to more obscure parts of the site.

The content of the site fits in beautifully with the rest of the color scheme. The animations are very well-produced and provide a wealth
of interactive information. The background color of each section of content is distinct from the others, making the structure very well-
defined and easy to read. Overall, this site has top-notch production quality and I cannot think of any meaningful objections to its design.

The layout I chose for my site was the single column. I did this because my site was already designed in this manner to a degree.
I polished it up a little and added headers and footers sections to give the structure more definition and to make styling easier.
I think this design fits the content of my site well, as the content is rather minimal and the navigation bar fits better horizontally
rather than vertically.
